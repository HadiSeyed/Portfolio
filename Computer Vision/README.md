## Digital Image Analysis and Understanding 

In DSCI 6050, Digital Image Analysis and Understanding, I did some works like Vectorization in Numpy, Image Processing, Image Transformations, Image Warping, Image Stitcher, Image Classification, and Exploration of Modern Computer Vision. Here are some example outputs from my project are shown below.
