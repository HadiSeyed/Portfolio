There  are many  libraries  available,  some  of  which  we  will  be  using,  and  you  are  welcome  to  use  them  with  one  exception:  if  the  library  or  a  function  within  it  performs  the  specific  function  you  are  asked  to  code,  you  may  not  use  that  other  than  perhaps  as  a  reference  to  compare  against. All  of  the  code  you  submit  must  be  your  own. You are welcome to turn in a completed jupyter notebook.\n",
