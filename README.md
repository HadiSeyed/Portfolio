## Style Transfer Research

I work with Dr. Hart, assistant professor of computer science at East Carolina University, in the field of Computer Vision research. My thesis topic investigates different approaches to style transfer. Specifically, how different style transfer techniques are affected by different mask sizes, image statistics, etc. Here are some example outputs from my research are shown below.

Code and additional examples can be found in the folder "Style Transfer Research"


## Blender Project

In CSCI 6820, Computer Graphics, I did Explore and work with advanced  and different concepts in 3D modeling using in Blender.
